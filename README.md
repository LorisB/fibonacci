Here we compare [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) 
algorithm implemented in
different programming languages in order to understand
which language compiles to shorter binary code and 
works faster.

To build it just run:

```bash
$ make
```

You will need to have [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) 
and [cpplint](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint) installed.
